Chutes and Ladders Rules:
Goal: Be the first player to reach space 50 on the board.
On a player's turn, they roll the die and move that many spaces
If a players roll would put them past space 50, they do not move
  Ex:
    A player on space 45 rolls a 6, this would put them on space 51
    Since this is past space 50, the player does not move
    The game then continues to the next players turn
If a player lands on the start of a chute or a ladder, they move to the
end of that chute or ladder before ending their turn
  Ex:
    If there is a chute on space 8. that leads to space 3
    then when a player lands on space 8, they follow the chute to space 3
    If there were a ladder on space 1 that leads to space 19
    then when a player lands on space 1, they follow the ladder to space 19
Nothing occurs if the player lands on the end of a chute or ladder
Once a player has moved, their turn is over
